1) types of data types
2) primitive vs reference
3) shallow vs deep copy
4) why promises were introduced 
5) if callback hell is problem then how nested components are not a problem
6) ways to create deep copy
7) if user input is there and val is updated when user types and we are using val as useEffect ependency , how ,many times useEffect is triggered.
8) If I have a table where user does multiple actions like sorting filtering and changing columns positions and on CLick of a button need to bring him to initial state. what would be an efficient way or approach to implement this.

// console.log(b)

b.manager.job="tester"
b.manager.teamMembers.push('B')

console.log(b,"b")
console.log(a,"a")
