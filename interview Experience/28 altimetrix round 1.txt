9) // Create a simple React component that includes a textarea and a live character counter below it. The counter should update as the user types
// Max => 300 characters

import { useState } from "react";

const LiveCharacterCount = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={value}
        maxLength={300}
        onChange={(e) => {
          if (count <= 300) {
            setValue(e.target.value);
            setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
          }
        }}
      />
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LiveCharacterCount;
