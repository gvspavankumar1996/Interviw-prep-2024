Mini Project: Micro Frontend Dashboard using Single-SPA and React
Project Overview
Create a Micro Frontend Dashboard using Single-SPA and React. This dashboard will
have two independent micro frontend applications:
1. Home App – Displays a welcome message and user details.
2. Profile App – Shows user profile details.
These micro frontends will be registered and orchestrated using Single-SPA.

Steps to Complete the Project
 Create a README file explaining the steps to execute the project.
 Publish your project in a public Git repository. The repository needs to contain
your name for easy identification.
 Reply to the same email in which you received the project with the Git link to
access your repository
 The project delivery deadline is 7 days from the email date.

Bonus Enhancements
✅ Add React Router for navigation between micro frontends.
✅ Implement Styled Components or Tailwind CSS for better UI.
✅ Use a global state management tool like Redux or Zustand.
