1Ô∏è‚É£ LRU Cache (Least Recently Used Cache)
Data Structures Required:
HashMap (Object in JS) ‚Üí For O(1) lookup of key-value pairs.
Doubly Linked List ‚Üí To track the order of usage efficiently.
Why?
HashMap ensures fast access.
Doubly Linked List helps in moving the least recently used element to the end in O(1) time.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Typeahead (Autocomplete / Search Suggestions)
Data Structures Required:
Trie (Prefix Tree) ‚Üí For efficient word searching.
Heap (Priority Queue) ‚Üí To rank search results.
Set (or Debouncing with a Queue) ‚Üí To avoid redundant API calls.
Why?
Trie provides fast prefix-based search (O(n) lookup).
Heap helps in sorting top results based on frequency.
Debouncing prevents excessive API requests.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Comments (Reddit, YouTube-style comments)
Data Structures Required:
Tree (Recursive Object or Adjacency List Representation)
Map (for quick parent-child lookup)
Why?
Comments are hierarchical (nested structure).
A Map helps in fast parent-child reference lookup.
Example Tree Structure:

js
Copy
Edit
const comments = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: "First comment",
    replies: [
      {
        id: 2,
        text: "Reply to first comment",
        replies: []
      }
    ]
  }
];

4Ô∏è‚É£ File Explorer (Windows Explorer, Google Drive)
Data Structures Required:
Tree (N-ary Tree or Adjacency List)
Stack (for navigation history)
Why?
File systems are hierarchical.
Stack enables "Back" and "Forward" navigation efficiently.
Example Tree Structure for a File System:

js
Copy
Edit
const fileSystem = {
  name: "root",
  type: "folder",
  children: [
    { name: "file1.txt", type: "file" },
    { 
      name: "Documents", 
      type: "folder", 
      children: [
        { name: "resume.pdf", type: "file" }
      ] 
    }
  ]
};

5Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Nested Tabs (Forms inside Tabs)
Data Structures Required:
Map or Object ‚Üí To store tab data dynamically.
Stack ‚Üí To track navigation history.
Why?
A Map enables fast retrieval of tab data.
Stack allows undoing actions within tabs.

6Ô∏è‚É£ React Component Rendering Optimization (Virtualization, Infinite Scroll)
Data Structures Required:
Linked List (for efficient element insertion/removal)
Binary Heap (for priority scheduling of updates)
Sliding Window / Queue (for managing visible elements in viewport)
Why?
Linked List prevents unnecessary re-renders.
Heap schedules updates based on priority.
Queue helps in maintaining a fixed number of visible items.

üî• Final Thoughts
For React machine coding rounds, focus on: ‚úÖ HashMaps (for quick lookups)
‚úÖ Trees (for nested structures like comments, file explorer)
‚úÖ Stacks & Queues (for navigation, undo-redo, pagination)
‚úÖ Tries & Heaps (for search and ranking problems)
‚úÖ Linked Lists (for efficient element removal in caches)

Would you like a hands-on React implementation of any of these? üöÄ
